echo    Routing Fix Applied - Testing Script  
echo ========================================
echo.

echo ✅ FIXED: ProtectedRoute role mapping issue
echo ✅ UPDATED: All routes now support both numeric and string roles
echo ✅ ADDED: Debug console logs to track routing behavior
echo.

echo What was fixed:
echo   - ProtectedRoute now handles both "TEACHER" and "2" role formats
echo   - All allowedRoles arrays include both formats: ["2", "TEACHER"]
echo   - Added role mapping fallback for compatibility
echo   - Enhanced debug logging to track routing decisions
echo.

echo Expected behavior:
echo   ✅ Teacher role "TEACHER" should access /teacher routes
echo   ✅ No more redirecting to homepage when clicking navigation
echo   ✅ Role-based access control working properly
echo   ✅ Console shows debug info for troubleshooting
echo.

echo Frontend is running on: http://localhost:3001
echo.

echo Test steps:
echo   1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
echo   2. Check console for "ProtectedRoute Debug" messages
echo   3. Try clicking different navigation items
echo   4. Verify no unwanted redirects to homepage
echo.

echo Opening browser...
start http://localhost:3001

echo.
echo Check console logs for routing debug information!
